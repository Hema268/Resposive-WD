            <h2>What is the Spiral Model?</h2>
            <p>The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. The phases typically include requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>
            
            <h2>Phases in Spiral Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Planning: </b>
                    The first phase of the Spiral Model is the planning phase, where the scope of the project is determined and a plan is created for the next iteration of the spiral.  
                </li>
                <li><b>Risk Analysis:</b>
                    In the risk analysis phase, the risks associated with the project are identified and evaluated.  
                </li>
                <li><b>Engineering</b>
                    In the engineering phase, the software is developed based on the requirements gathered in the previous iteration.  
                </li>
                <li><b>Evaluation: </b>
                    In the evaluation phase, the software is evaluated to determine if it meets the customerâ€™s requirements and if it is of high quality.  
                </li>
                <li><b>Planning: </b>
                    The next iteration of the spiral begins with a new planning phase, based on the results of the evaluation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantages of the Spiral Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Good for large projects</li>
                <li>High amount of risk analysis</li>
                <li>Iterative and Incremental Approach</li>
                <li>Requirements can be captured more accurately.</li>
                <li>Allows extensive use of prototypes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Disadvantages of the Spiral Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Management is more complex.</li>
                <li>Too much dependability on Risk Analysis:</li>
                <li>Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects.</li>
                <li>Difficulty in time management:</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Example of Spiral Model</h2>
             <p>Example of developing an online learning platform using the Spiral Model:</p>
             <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
             <li><b>Planning: </b>Define objectives and gather requirements for the platform.</li>
            <li><b>Risk Analysis: </b>Identify and prioritize potential risks such as technical challenges and usability issues.</li>
            <li><b>Spiral 1: </b>: Develop a prototype with core features and gather feedback.</li>
            <li><b>Spiral 2: </b>Enhance functionality based on feedback, add features like quizzes and discussion forums.</li>
            <li><b>iteration Evaluation: </b>Continuously gather feedback, address issues, and refine requirements through multiple spirals.</li>
            <li><b>Incremental Release:</b>Release updated versions of the platform with improvements based on stakeholder input and risk management.</li>
            <li><b>Continuous Improvement:</b>Iterate through cycles of development, testing, and feedback to evolve the platform over time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throughout this process, each phase is completed before moving on to the next, following a linear and sequential approach characteristic of the Waterfall Model.</p>
