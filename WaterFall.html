            <h2>What is the Waterfall Model?</h2>
            <p>The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. The phases typically include requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>
            
            <h2>Phases in Waterfall Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Requirements Analysis: </b>
                   This phase involves gathering and documenting all the requirements for the software product. This includes understanding the needs of the stakeholders, such as clients, end-users, and business analysts. Requirements are typically gathered through interviews, surveys, workshops, and other communication channels. The output of this phase is a comprehensive requirements document that outlines what the software should do.
                </li>
                <li><b>Design: </b>
                    Once the requirements are understood, the next step is to design the system architecture and software components based on these requirements. This phase involves creating detailed technical specifications, including system architecture, database design, user interface design, and any other relevant design documents. The goal is to create a blueprint for how the software will be developed and implemented.
                </li>
                <li><b>Implementation: </b>
                    In this phase, the actual coding or development of the software takes place based on the design specifications created in the previous phase. Developers write code according to the requirements and design documents, following coding standards and best practices. The focus is on implementing the functionality outlined in the requirements document.
                </li>
                <li><b>Testing: </b>
                    Once the individual components of the software have been developed, they are integrated together to create the complete system. This phase involves testing the integrated system to ensure that all components work together as expected and meet the requirements specified earlier. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are performed to identify and fix any defects or issues.
                </li>
                <li><b>Deployment: </b>
                    After the software has been developed and tested, it is deployed to the production environment or made available to end-users. This involves installing the software on the appropriate hardware and configuring it to work in the production environment. Users may also be trained on how to use the software effectively.
                </li>
                <li><b>Maintenance: </b>
                    Once the software is deployed, it enters the maintenance phase, where ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates are provided as needed. This phase ensures that the software remains functional and meets the evolving needs of the users. Maintenance activities may include addressing user feedback, fixing defects, optimizing performance, and adding new features or enhancements.

            <h2>Advantages of the Waterfall Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear and well-defined requirements at the beginning of the project</li>
                <li>Structured and easy to understand</li>
                <li>Phases in the Classical Waterfall model are processed one at a time.</li>
                <li>Works well for projects with stable requirements</li>
                <li>Processes, actions, and results are very well documented.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulties in accommodating changes once the project is in the testing phase</li>
                <li>Client may not see the product until the end of the project</li>
                <li>Risk of late feedback and discovery of issues</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Example of Waterfall Model</h2>
             <p>Imagine a project to build a mobile application:</p>
             <li><b>Requirements Analysis:</b>Gather all requirements from the client, such as features, user interface design, and performance expectations.</li>
            <li><b>Design:</b>Create a detailed plan for the app, including architecture, database structure, and user flow diagrams.</li>
            <li><b>Implementation:</b>Developers write code based on the design, creating the app's functionality and user interface.</li>
            <li><b>Testing:</b>Combine all code modules, test the app for bugs, and ensure it meets all requirements.</li>
            <li><b>Deployment:</b>Release the app to the app store or other distribution channels, making it available to users.</li>
            <li><b>Maintenance:</b>Provide ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes as needed to keep the app running smoothly and meeting user needs.</li>
            <p>Throughout this process, each phase is completed before moving on to the next, following a linear and sequential approach characteristic of the Waterfall Model.</p>
