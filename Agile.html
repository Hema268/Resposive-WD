            <h2>What is the Agile Model?</h2>
            <p>
                The Agile Model was primarily designed to help a project adapt quickly to change requests. So, the main aim of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. To accomplish this task, agility is required. Agility is achieved by fitting the process to the project and removing activities that may not be essential for a specific project. Also, anything that is a waste of time and effort is avoided. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Phases in Agile Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Requirements Analysis: </b>
                    In this step, the development team must gather the requirements, by interaction with the customer. development team should plan the time and effort needed to build the project. Based on this information you can evaluate technical and economical feasibility.
                </li>
                <li><b>Design Requirements: </b>
                    In this step, the development team will use user-flow-diagram or high-level UML diagrams to show the working of the new features and show how they will apply to the existing software. Wireframing and designing user interfaces are done in this phase.   
                </li>
                <li><b>Construction / Iteration: </b>
                    In this step, development team members start working on their project, which aims to deploy a working product.   
                </li>
                <li><b>Testing / Quality Assurance: </b>
                    Testing involves Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and System Testing. 
                </li>
                    <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                       <li><b>Unit Testing: </b>Unit testing involves testing individual units of the software.</li>
                       <li><b>Integration Testing: </b>It is used to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined.</li>
                       <li><b>System Testing: </b>Goal is to ensure that the software meets the requirements of the users and that it works correctly in all possible scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Deployment: </b>
                    In this step, the development team will deploy the working project to end users.   
                </li>
                <li><b>Feedback: </b>
                    This is the last step of the Agile Model. In this, the team receives feedback about the product and works on correcting bugs based on feedback provided by the customer
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantages of the Agile Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Working through Pair programming produces well-written compact programs which have fewer errors as compared to programmers working alone.</li>
                <li>
                    It reduces the total development time of the whole project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agile development emphasizes face-to-face communication among team members, leading to better collaboration and understanding of project goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Customer representatives get the idea of updated software products after each iteration. So, it is easy for him to change any requirement if needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agile development puts the customer at the center of the development process, ensuring that the end product meets their needs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Disadvantages of the Agile Model</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>The lack of formal documents creates confusion and important decisions taken during different phases can be misinterpreted at any time by different team members.</li>
               <li>It is not suitable for handling complex dependencies.</li>
               <li>The agile model depends highly on customer interactions so if the customer is not clear, then the development team can be driven in the wrong direction.</li>
               <li>Due to the absence of proper documentation, when the project completes and the developers are assigned to another project, maintenance of the developed project can become a problem.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Example of Agile Model</h2>
             <p>developing an e-commerce website using the Agile Process Model</p>
             <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li><b>Product Backlog:</b>
                    Create a list of desired features like user registration, product browsing, and checkout.
                </li>
                <li><b>Sprint Planning:</b>
                    Choose a subset of features for the first sprint, break them into tasks, and commit to completing them.
                </li>
                <li><b>Sprint Development:</b>
                    Implement selected features iteratively, holding daily meetings to track progress.
                </li>
                <li><b>Sprint Review: </b>
                    Demonstrate completed features to stakeholders, gather feedback, and adjust priorities.
                </li>
                <li><b>Sprint Retrospective: </b>
                    Reflect on the sprint, identify improvements, and plan for the next iteration.
                </li>
                <li><b>Iterative Development: </b>
                    Repeat the cycle, adding new features and enhancements in subsequent sprints.
                </li>
                <li><b>Release Planning: </b>
                    Plan releases based on feature completion and customer needs, delivering value incrementally.
                </li>
             </ul>
             <p>Throughout the Agile Process Model, collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness are key principles guiding the development of the e-commerce website. The iterative and incremental approach allows for continuous feedback and adaptation, ensuring that the final product meets customer needs and delivers value effectively.
