        <h1>Process Models</h1>
        <p class="definition">A process model in software engineering is a standardized framework that defines the activities, tasks, and workflows involved in developing software systems. These models provide a systematic approach to software development, outlining phases, milestones, and deliverables that guide the entire development process. Each model offers a structured way to manage and execute software projects, helping teams to organize their work efficiently and effectively.</p>

                <p>
                    This is a sequential, linear approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. The phases typically include requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

            <div class="text">
                <h1>Incremental Model</h1>
                <p>
                    In this model, the software is developed and delivered incrementally in multiple stages or increments. Each increment adds new functionality to the system, allowing for early delivery of usable features and frequent feedback from stakeholders.

                <p>
                    The V-model is a variation of the waterfall model that emphasizes the relationship between each phase of development and its corresponding testing phase. Each stage of development has a corresponding testing phase, forming a "V" shape when represented graphically.

                <p>
                    The spiral model combines elements of both the waterfall model and iterative development. It involves repeated cycles of risk analysis, prototyping, development, and testing, with each cycle expanding upon the previous one.

                <p>
                    The Prototype Model is an iterative development approach where a prototype is created, evaluated, refined, and then used as the basis for subsequent versions or the final product. It involves building a scaled-down, simplified version of the software system to demonstrate key features and gather feedback from stakeholders.

                <p>
                    Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Teams work in short cycles called sprints, delivering small, incremental releases of the software and adapting to changing requirements and feedback.
